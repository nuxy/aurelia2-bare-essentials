# aurelia2-bare-essentials

A light-weight, slightly modified [Aurelia 2](https://aurelia.io) project seed.

## Notes

While this project was bootstrapped by [aurelia/new](https://github.com/aurelia/new), I have _made several changes_ outside the scope of the original release.  For example:

- Integration of [VS Code extensions](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/VSCode) and related tools.
- [SASS](https://sass-lang.com) support including markup examples.
- **Removal of items not applicable to my workflow**.

## Developers

### CLI options

Run [ESLint](https://eslint.org) on project sources:

    $ npm run lint

Transpile ES2017 sources (using [TypeScript](https://www.typescriptlang.org/docs/handbook/compiler-options.html)) and minify to a distribution:

    $ npm run build

Launch a development server instance accessible at [http://localhost:9000](http://localhost:9000)

    $ npm run start

Run [Jest](https://jestjs.io) integration tests:

    $ npm run test
